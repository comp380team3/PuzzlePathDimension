       * The relevant formulas are:
       * - x = rcos(theta)
       * - y = rsin(theta)
       * so that is why the texture's width is still used for calculating the y-coordinate 
       * instead of the height.
       * 
       * The flipped y-axis is also the reason why the angle passed to Math.Sin() is multiplied by -1.
       * 
       * I think that helps you and my future self figure out what's going on here :p 
       * After all, who knows if we have to change this later? -Jorenz
